Honeycomb
=========

Honeycomb is an open source storage engine plugin for MySQL that enables MySQL 
to store and query tables directly in HBase. By storing tables directly in HBase 
and allowing direct access to MySQL for queries and modification, Honeycomb enables 
developers and applications to work with the familiar and powerful relational model, 
while allowing access to the data by existing Hadoop-based tools. 

Honeycomb dynamically implements a relational data model on top of HBase that 
allows for efficient querying.
