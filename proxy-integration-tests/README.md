# Proxy Integration Tests

This project contains the integration test suite run to ensure proper execution against the supported backend implementation(s).

## Running Tests

The integration tests are run by the [Maven Failsafe Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin) and may be executed with:

```Bash
mvn verify
```

## Configuration

To run the test suite against a specific backend implementation, the 'defaultAdapter' property in the
application configuration file must be configured to the desired backend.

For example, to run the integration tests against the HBase backend ensure that the `honeycomb.xml` contains:

```XML
<defaultAdapter>hbase</defaultAdapter>
```

>*This will require that HBase is accessible to execute the test suite.*
