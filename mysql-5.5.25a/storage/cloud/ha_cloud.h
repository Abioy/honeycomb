/** @file ha_cloud.h

    @brief
  The ha_cloud engine is a cloudbed storage engine for cloud purposes only;
  it does nothing at this point. Its purpose is to provide a source
  code illustration of how to begin writing new storage engines; see also
  /storage/cloud/ha_cloud.cc.

    @note
  Please read ha_cloud.cc before reading this file.
  Reminder: The cloud storage engine implements all methods that are *required*
  to be implemented. For a full list of all methods that you can implement, see
  handler.h.

   @see
  /sql/handler.h and /storage/cloud/ha_cloud.cc
